# minimal-Reflow-Plate
A DIY heat plate for soldering / reflow with an ESP32 and SSR

For creating my PCB projects I ordered a heating plate and did the reflow process manually -- switching the plate on and off with a fuse... Then ordered an Solid State relay, MAX6675 with thermocouple and 220V to 5V converter. Together with an ESP32, button and OLED Display I created this minimal example of an reflow oven/plate.

The program code is originally generated by ChatGPT -- e.g. the PID control section. The plotting of the profile I needed to modify, also added button input functionality. The profile is for Sn63/Pb37 soldering paste but can be changed easily. Inspiration and code snippets I used from [Tiny Reflow Controller with OLED display][[https://www.electronics-lab.com/project/tiny-reflow-controller-oled-display/]] and from [uReflowOven][[https://github.com/dukeduck1984/uReflowOven-Esp32-Micropython]] (here you also find leadfree reflow profile).
